# Test Driven Development
Demonstrate Test Driven Development

## Concept:
Demonstrate how to use tests to drive the writing of your code, a key component of agile programming.This repository covers a range of practical topics that can help Java developers get up and running with test-driven development (TDD).

### What is test-driven development?
So, let's start with really understanding what is meant by test-driven development. Well, simply put, test-driven development means that we use tests to drive the writing of our code. 
In general, there's a workflow which we use which is normally described as red, green, refactor.

Red means that we'll be writing tests of business logic that we expect initially to fail. They'll fail because we haven't yet written any code to make the test pass. A test is something that'll validate that some code we have written is performing correctly. 
Green means that we'll write code, or correct code, so that our tests pass. 
And then refactor means that once we have our tests passing, we'll be able to refactor out code and our tests to make them more efficient. 
For now, something that is important to understand is that as we develop the functionality for our applications, we're going to be writing tests first before we write any code to make the tests pass. And this is going to be an iterative process. Each piece of functionality could require us to write a lot of tests.
